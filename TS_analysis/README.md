# Time Series Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to evaluate the state of new housing construction at the state level. To this end, each student will evaluate economic data (as well as other potentially related variables) for given state to shed light on the associations between new housing construction activities and economic (or other) factors.  

## Guideline

Response Variable:  New Private Housing Units Authorized by Building Permits (e.g., see FRED)

Explanatory Variables: You may choose potential explanatory variables as you see necessary and justifiable. For example, you may consider unemployment, employment, or other economic factors, data on income and wages, health related data, housing related information (e.g., housing starts) as well as any other potentially related variables. You must consider at least 2 explanatory variables for the state under study.

## Data Sources:
Potential data sources may include, Federal agencies (e.g., the Federal Reserves, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau) and State agencies. In cases that the source of data is not based on official agencies, please contact me so we make sure data is reliable (this does not include databases by third-parties that may provide official data).

A good source for state level economic data is the Federal Reserves.
